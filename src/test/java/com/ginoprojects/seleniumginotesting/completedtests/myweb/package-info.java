 *
 * This package is going to serve as a Selenium training where I'm going to use my own website (ginogalotti.com) as the test object.
 * The site doesn't contain that much, so the test is going to focus on a little of navigation and checking that some objetcs are in
 * the correct page.
 *
 * Scope:
 *  .Learning Selenium principles. How to find objects, interact with them and assert where they are.
 *  .Following TDD principles, focusing on MyWebTest class and only writing MyWebPage functions when the tests are failing.
 *
 * Lessons learned:
 *  .The web editor has created the HTML objects in a way that make them quite inaccessible. The easiest way is using XPATH with an automated tool,
 *  but this is going to fail whenever the editor change the distribution.
 *  .Starting a chrome driver was way harder that I thought.
